# Smart Brain

## Description

This is a web application I built as the final project of the The Complete Web Developer Zero To Mastery course on Udemy. It is an app that can detect faces in images! Simply provide the URL to an image online, and the program will find the faces in the picture.

## Technologies

The frontend of this application was built using **React.js** and the backend was built with **Node.js** and **Express.js**. **PostgreSQL** was used as the database technology to enable persistant storage of users.
